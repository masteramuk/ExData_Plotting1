# INTRODUCTION
This is week 1 assignment from Exploratory Data Analysis course by Cousera taught by Dr Peng. It contains 4 source code in the folder source-code and 4 plot graph in plot-png folder

## sourceCode folder
Store all source code for the following purpose:
1. plot1.R - to generate a histogram of global active power(kilowatts) and create plot1.png
2. plot2.R - to generate a plot of global active power vs. time and create plot2.png
3. plot3.R - to generate a plot of different submetering vs time and create plot3.png
4. plot4.R - to generate 4 plots in 1 space (GAP vs. time, Vol vs. time, submetering vs. time and GRP vs. time) and store as plot4.png

## plotPng
The foloder store all graphs as png file generated by running each individual R scripts in source-code folder
